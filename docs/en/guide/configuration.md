# Yinyun Architecture and Configuration Guide

Yinyun follows a **zero-configuration, ready-to-use** design while providing flexible configuration files and environment-variable overrides for advanced deployments.

## Configuration Loading Hierarchy and Execution Priority

Yinyun defines its defaults in `src/defaultConfig.ts`. During startup, the configuration parser distributes values to the server runtime and the browser configuration exposed through `/js/config.js`.

The loading and merging of configurations follow the priority sequence from high to low below. High-priority options will **hardly override** the corresponding keys of low-priority ones:

1. **Runtime Environment Variables (Environment Variables)**: Has very high priority. For example, `PORT=9527`.
2. **WebDAV Cloud Data (WebDAV Cloud Data)**: If WebDAV is configured, the system will try to restore from the cloud on startup. **Restored cloud content will overwrite the local `config.js` and trigger a hot-reload**.
3. **Persistent Configuration File**: The file specified by `CONFIG_PATH`, or `<DATA_PATH>/config.js` by default.
4. **Bundled Configuration**: The `config.js` file shipped with the application, used only as the initial baseline.
5. **System-level Default Constants (Default Consts)**: Defaults in `src/defaultConfig.ts`.

## Core Configuration Parameter Dictionary

The following list an array of environment variable (ENV) parameters that affect critical service behaviors:

### I. Network Communication and Underlying Service Configuration

This module manages the Node.js listening process and the basic settings of the network stack.

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :-------------------- | :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT` | `9527` | Integer | **Service listening port**. It is recommended to avoid using other high-frequency ports in the host (such as 80, 443, 3306). |
| `BIND_IP` | `0.0.0.0` | String | **Scope of service binding IP interfaces**. Set to `127.0.0.1` to accept only local Lookback calls; set to `0.0.0.0` means listening to all internal and external available network adapters of the host simultaneously. |
| `SERVER_NAME` | `My Sync Server` | String | **Sync service name**. Showed in client connections. |
| `PROXY_HEADER` | `x-real-ip` | String | **Reverse proxy remote IP penetration identifier**. When the system runs behind reverse proxies or load balancers such as Nginx, it is used to extract the true client source IP address to ensure accurate traceability of equipment audit logs. |
| `PROXY_ALL_ENABLED` | `false` | Boolean | **Enable global outgoing request proxy**. If enabled, network requests from the server (e.g. search, resolving) will go through the proxy. |
| `PROXY_ALL_ADDRESS` | `''` | String | **Proxy address**. Supports `http://` or `socks5://`, e.g. `socks5://127.0.0.1:10808`. |
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | `false` | Boolean | **System telemetry feedback circuit breaker**. Set to `true` will completely block anonymous state probe packets between the system and external nodes, and disable all system-level new version updates or announcement distributions. |

Starting with v1.5.0, the Web player is fixed at `/` and the management console is fixed at `/admin`. `ADMIN_PATH` and `PLAYER_PATH` are no longer supported. The former `/music` Web route returns 404; the `/server/music` filesystem mount remains unchanged.

### II. Persistence and Account Sandbox Management Strategy

This module involves monitoring the status of connected clients and isolation specifications at the physical storage level.

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FRONTEND_PASSWORD` | `123456` | String | **Control Panel Root-level encrypted access credential**. Used to verify credentials entering `\` (the global scope of the control panel). To prevent unauthorized external network access, it is recommended to re-authorize and change it immediately upon the first setup. |
| `MAX_SNAPSHOT_NUM` | `10` | Integer | **Time snapshot retention threshold setting**. The maximum allowed length of the historical archive snapshot queue retained by the system. Early histories exceeding this queue limit will be cyclically discarded by the underlying timed GC task. |
| `DATA_PATH` | `./data` | String | **Data directory path**. Specifies where persistence data (users.json, snapshots) are stored. |
| `LOG_PATH` | `./logs` | String | **Log directory path**. Specifies where system logs are stored. |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | `<DATA_PATH>/config.js` | String | **Persistent config path**. Docker deployments should use `/server/data/config.js`. |
| `ENABLE_LOGIN_USER_CACHE_RESTRICTION` | `false` | Boolean | **Restrict cache settings for logged-in users**. If enabled, non-admin logged-in users will be restricted from modifying core cache settings. |
| `ENABLE_CACHE_SIZE_LIMIT` | `false` | Boolean | **Enable automatic cache cleanup**. If enabled, the system will monitor and limit the total user cache size, and automatically delete oldest files (LRU) when the limit is reached. |
| `CACHE_SIZE_LIMIT` | `2000` | Integer | **Cache size limit (MB)**. The threshold at which the auto-cleanup mechanism is triggered. |

### III. WebDAV Configuration

The underlying periodic polling asynchronous daemon of the service will only be fully awakened if the following environment variable group is authorized (especially the `WEBDAV_URL` link effectively takes effect):

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEBDAV_URL` | `''` | String | Various complete URIs with standard WebDAV protocol gateway interfaces (including HTTPS declaration), for example: `https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav/Sync`. |
| `WEBDAV_USERNAME` | `''` | String | Authorization identification name used for WebDAV service node handshake authentication. |
| `WEBDAV_PASSWORD` | `''` | String | Remote WebDAV gateway access key (highly recommended to use an independent application-specific authorization password to reduce secondary leakage risks). |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL` | `60` | Integer | Cold shrinking timed parameters (unit: minutes) that trigger full thermal backup and pull comparison synchronization flow periods. |

> 🔖 **Stateful Resurrection and Initialization Mechanism**:
> 1. **Cloud-First Restore**: If the variables are detected on startup, the system prioritizes pulling archives from the cloud.
> 2. **Environment-Driven Persistence**: If the cloud config is empty (e.g., first deployment in Docker/Cloud), the system will **automatically persist the current effective configuration (such as ports, passwords set via environment variables) into the local `config.js` and upload it to the cloud** for initialization. This ensures you can establish the initial cloud data solely through environment variables.

### IV. Playlist Management Strategy

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LIST_ADD_MUSIC_LOCATION_TYPE` | `top` | String | **New song location**. `top` (add to the top) or `bottom` (add to the bottom). |

### V. Subsonic Protocol Configuration

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SUBSONIC_ENABLE` | `true` | Boolean | **Enable Subsonic protocol**. Allows connections from Subsonic-compatible clients. |
| `SUBSONIC_PATH` | `'/rest'` | String | **Subsonic access path**. Default is `/rest`. |

### VI. Business Feature Extension Configuration

| Environment Variable Mapping Key (ENV) | System Default Value | Data Type | Scope and Applicable Scenarios |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SINGER_SOURCE_PRIORITY` | `'tx,wy'` | String | **Singer source priority**. Controls the priority order for fetching singer details, photos, and Mid. Available values are `tx` (Tencent) and `wy` (Netease), separated by commas. |

### VII. (Advanced Feature) Silent Preset Accounts in CLI Environment

With the pre-declaration strategy at the operating system level, users can statically write accounts into the data persistence layer within the server initialization startup sequence without skipping graphical interface configuration:

Based on the prefix regex extraction mechanism: Adopt the naming rule of `LX_USER_<target signature string>=<password string>` to write into environment variables to achieve authorized interception and building file execution.

#### Example of environment variable dispatch startup:

```bash
# Execute this system declaration, and the accompanying script task will land these three entity records into the data system for authorized issuance.
export LX_USER_foo="mypassword123"
export LX_USER_bar="mypassword321"
export LX_USER_hello="12345"
npm run start
```

*(Note: After the successful accompanying system control operation mentioned above, this memory object will be converted into entity data and permanently archived to the mounted `<DATA_PATH>/users.json` file for continuous function verification.)*

---

When using Docker environments to orchestrate services, it is recommended that you directly convert the contents of this configuration file mapping manual into an `environment` array in `docker-compose.yml`, or append `-e [KEY]=[VALUE]` to the container parameter adjustment command to achieve system feature definitions and smooth startup.
